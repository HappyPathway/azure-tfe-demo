Nvidia Terraform Notes

packer -> azure images
How much bake?  SaltStack. 

What would a compelling demo look like?
building an image in packer, have it availabe in Azure. 
Deploy machines with that iamge through Terraform. 

Audience: 
 - Cloud Architect
 - Security
 - Automation Team 
   - SaltStack - developer their own app, might be sensitive.

- Reason: 
    strong desire within devops team to move away from new (SaltStack) tool. 
    pain-points: security, no guard-rails, cant control capacity.

Salt Cloud Vs. Terraform:
  - doesn't manage state.
